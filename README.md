üòÑ Eigen Emotions: Detecting Emotions From Facial Expressions
Eigen Emotions is a computer vision project that detects emotions from facial expressions using classical image processing techniques and high-level linear algebra. By combining the Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection and a novel eigen-based approach for emotion classification, this system showcases the potential of non-deep-learning methods in affective computing.

üìñ Overview
Key Features:
Face Detection: Utilizes the Viola-Jones algorithm with Haar-like features for efficient and accurate face detection.
Emotion Recognition: Employs eigenfaces, derived through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to classify emotions.
Emotions Detected: Happy, Angry, Sad, and Surprised.
Real-Time Testing: Demonstrated on live users in a library setting, highlighting practical applicability.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Face Detection:
Preprocessing: Normalizes image lighting using mean intensity adjustment.
Algorithm: Viola-Jones, leveraging Haar-like features and integral images for rapid detection.
Emotion Classification:
Preprocessing:
Converts images to grayscale.
Adjusts mean intensity for lighting normalization.
Enhances contrast using histogram equalization.
Eigenfaces:
PCA is used to derive eigenfaces for each emotion.
A scoring system selects the most relevant eigenfaces for classification.
Classification:
Feature extraction with eigenfaces.
Multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a one-vs-rest strategy for emotion recognition.

üîç Results
Real-World Testing:
High accuracy for happy and surprised emotions.
Challenges with sad and angry emotions when expressions were subtle.
Overall success rate improved with user prompts for more expressive emotions.
Scalability: The algorithm performs well with reduced training data, demonstrating robustness.
